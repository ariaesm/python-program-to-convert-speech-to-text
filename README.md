How to Convert Speech to Text in Python 
Speech recognition is the ability of computer software to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to human-readable text. In this tutorial, you will learn how you can convert speech to text in Python using the SpeechRecognition library.

As a result, we do not need to build any machine learning model from scratch, this library provides us with convenient wrappers for various well-known public speech recognition APIs (such as Google Cloud Speech API, IBM Speech To Text, etc.).

Note that if you do not want to use APIs, and directly perform inference on machine learning models instead, then definitely check this tutorial, in which I'll show you how you can use the current state-of-the-art machine learning model to perform speech recognition in Python.
